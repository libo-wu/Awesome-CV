      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
        \item Solved the issue that motions sensors (PIR sensors) could not detect stationary occupants.
        \item Created a liquid crystal (LC) infrared shutter that can modulate long-wave infrared radiation with low driving voltage and ultra low power consumption (4.8V driving voltage with $<$10nA).
        \item Manufactured Polymer Dispersed Liquid Crystal (PDLC) infrared shutter with 8\% modulation degree.
        \item Developed a synchronized low-energy electronically-chopped PIR sensor for true presence detection by applied the created LC shutter to a PIR sensor packaged in an extremely low power embedded system ($\sim20\mu$W) [patent pending].  
        \item Conducted experiments for presence detection. Reached 99.8\% accuracy for true presence detection and over 97.7\% accuracy for realistic long-term ($>$20 hours) test consisting of multiple activities. 
        \item Optimized the control strategy of lighting and HVAC system with distributed sensor network.

      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
        \item Integrated one thermopile sensor and rotating optical mask to acquire compressive infrared signals from human.
        \item Designed a random binary mask to compress the radiation within the field of view (FOV) [patent pending].
        \item Built a mathematical model that shows the linear relationship among the output signal of sensor, the rotating mask and radiation distributions. Found the relationship could be solved by compressive sensing theory.
        \item Reconstructed spatial radiation distributions using basis pursuit denoising algorithm to recover localization information.
        \item Reached over 90\% accuracy for localization of indoor the human object with a very low cost (less than \$10).

{Sept. 2017 - Mar. 2018} % Date(s)
{
  \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
    \item Used a single passive infrared (PIR) and an optical shutter embedded with micro-controller unit (MCU) in the device to analyze occupancy status of indoor environment, such as presence, localization, and facial direction. 
    \item Utilized a innovative rotating optical shutter in front of the PIR sensor to modulation the received infrared radiation in a nonlinear manner.
    \item Extracted two features from the analog signals from PIR sensors (peak to peak value, and pulse width). 
    \item Applied machine learning algorithms (SVM and Neural Network) to improve the performance in predicting and classifying occupancy situations that reached 98\% accuracy in localization.  
    \item Extended the functionality of PIR sensors in indoor occupancy detection with high performance, such as human tracking with 0.44 m RSME, localization with 98\% accuracy and facial direction detection with 83\% accuracy.
