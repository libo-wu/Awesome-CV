      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
        \item Solved the common issue that all commercial motions sensors (PIR sensors) could not detect stationary occupants.
        \item Created a liquid crystal (LC) infrared shutter that can modulate long-wave infrared radiation with low driving voltage and ultra low power consumption ($<0.1\mu$A).
        \item Manufactured Polymer Dispersed Liquid Crystal (PDLC) infrared shutter with high contrast ratio.
        \item Developed a synchronized low-energy electronically-chopped PIR sensor for true presence detection by applying the created LC shutter to a PIR sensor and being packaged in an extremely low power embedded system ($\sim20\mu$W).
        \item Designed realistic protocols for experiments which cover most regular daily actions and activities. 
        \item Extracted statistical features and ran machine learning algorithms (NN, SVM, Random Forest, etc.) for presence detection.
        \item Reached 99.9\% accuracy for true presence detection and over 97.7\% accuracy for realistic, long-term test.
